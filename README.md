# Foream_est_mri_emg
foream_est_mri_emg is a repository containing the code for the estimation of the forearm muscles activation using an electrical model
describing the morphology of a section of the forearm. See references for more information. 

## Usage
To run the script on MATLAB:

```Matlab
main_estimation_WinWidth
```
## Project Status
The code for the generation of the graph from the MRI slice need to be added.
